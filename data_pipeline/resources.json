There is no cost to the family, which means their income can funnel to getting out of debt and building savings so they can re-establish themselves in permanent housing at the end of their stay. Families can participate for up to two years and pay minimal rent. Clients have access to EFAA’s food bank and assistance with other basic needs, and work closely with a case manager. This longer stay can mean that a parent is able to finish their education, or secure a good job to rebuild from a crisis.\"",

For 90 minutes prior to opening BOHO staff and volunteers clear out furniture, put down blankets on the floors, and set out donated food; for 60 minutes after closing, BOHO staff and volunteers sweep/mop/vacuum floors, clean bathrooms, empty trash, and replace furnishings so that the building is restored for its normal operations.\"",

Residents come primarily from Colorado, but we have had residents who were from other locations. Typically, the applicants arrive early in their pregnancy and stay until 3 months after the birth of their baby. Our facility can house up to 7 women and their babies.  It provides a family environment where women can participate in group living, which helps to give support and promote friendships that will hopefully last long after leaving Mother House.  We often invite our alumni back to visit with current residents and continue to offer our support when they might need it.\"",

Note that we are not able to support certain levels of physical or mental limitations. We employ the homeless guests who show a desire to overcome their addiction(s) and/or situation. After a few interviews and discussions a guest will be hired on a part-time basis, which allows for resume building and the opportunity to rejoin the work environment.
