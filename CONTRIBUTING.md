# Contributing

Before contributing, please review and abide by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 1. Find an Issue Pending Development, Needing Help, or Asking a Question

Want to develop? All issues that have been approved for development, but have not been started will be labelled
as **Status: Pending**.

We'd love your input on possible new features. Some issues aren't ready for development and won't have a status label.
These issues may need more input before being approved and instead be labelled **Type: Help Wanted**.

Maybe you have the answer to someone's question. Look through any issues labelled with **Type: Help Wanted** and comment with your answer.

## 2. Work on an Issue

Once you have have found an issue you feel comfortable working on, request to work on the issue and we'll label the issue
as **Status: In Progress** to make sure others don't work on it as well.

Then, create a new branch off the current `master`.

### Branch Naming

All feature branch names should briefly describe what the branch addresses using
[kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles).

For example, if you wanted to create a branch that update the way a service was displayed, you could name the
branch **`update-service-display`**.

## 3. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once you believe your feature is ready for production, create a PR and reference what issue this addresses in the PR's
description.

If there any updates requested, please make those updates on your local branch and re-push that branch to the repository.

If approved, project managers will handle merging and deploying.
